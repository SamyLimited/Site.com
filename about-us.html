                Samy Limited was established in 2009 and has over this period
                grown to become one of the UK’s leading independent retail
                operators of convenience forecourts & stand-alone stores. The
                business currently operates or manages directly 32 convenience
                stores or forecourts.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 lead">
                Samy Limited is not a corporate retailer and we are proud of our
                independence which we believe is a key strength that allows us
                to respond to our customer and local markets. Our stores &
                forecourts operate and trade under a variety of fascia’s or
                brands that are appropriate to each of the catchments & location
                they serve. Our independence and that retail flexibility allows
                us to build on that competitive advantage
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 lead">
                At present, within the Samy Limited portfolio we trade as
                Budgens, Spar, Londis & Premier. Our ambition is to become a
                national operator but as we grow we are currently focussing our
                attention on Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, the Midlands and
                South Yorkshire as well as the North East & Tyneside. In each
                location, we operate we have a reputation for building sales in
                each of the opportunities we have converted & brought across to
                our Group.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 lead">
                As a business, our growth phase only really commenced in earnest
                2013 and since then we have grown modestly at a rate of only 1
                or 2 stores per annum. Prior to that Samy Limited were focussed
                on building the business’s reputation for customer service &
                quality as a commission forecourt operator. This drive allowed
                us to build our brand to 16 within the Cambridge & Colchester
                area. Our ambition is to increase our business within the
                existing areas of operation to c100 stores within the next 3-5
                years.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 lead">
                In 2012, Samy Limited opened our first truly ‘independent’
                forecourt store at Tudor lodge service station in Middlesbrough.
                This has proved to be a huge success. Through a combination of
                investment in people & good retail standards, we have been
                successful in increasing weekly fuel sales by 260% & average
                weekly shop sales by 280%. ​
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 lead">
                In late 2018, through the growth & increasing strength of the
                business we were able to begin to look at corporate
                acquisitions. During that period Samy Limited acquired &
                converted two former Central England Stores to the Budgens
                fascia in Leicester & Birmingham and the sales performance in
                both has been extremely encouraging.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 lead">
                During 2019, we were able to undertake a complex portfolio
                acquisition & conversion of 8 trading stores from the
                Sainsbury’s Store Limited to the Budgens fascia. These stores
                are located predominately in Yorkshire & the North East and
                provide Samy Limited with a solid base for growth. This was
                entirely funded through equity from the business. Whilst it is
                early days in the transition we are encouraged both by the
                enthusiasm of the colleagues who chose to TUPE across and join
                our journey as well as the sales performance as we look to build
                our presence & reputation in these areas.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 lead">
                As we are a relatively young Company who operate a flat, open
                structure where talent & hard work is recognised and has an
                opportunity to shape our business and it culture. We value local
                experience & knowledge which is a cornerstone of independent
                retailing as we have the flexibility to respond to local demand
                and shape our offer accordingly.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 lead">
                We currently have over 180 colleagues within the team and the
                Companies current annual turnover (excluding our fuel sales
                etc.) is in excess of £22 million. Although we are a young,
                small Company, Samy Limited is committed to creating one of the
                UK’s most dynamic, customer focussed, performance and
                learning-driven organisations for our colleagues where the best
                and brightest work together to create a responsible, respectful
                and delightful working environment. Our customer experience &
                offer are key but all our colleagues at the various stores are
                playing a key part in the success of that journey. The recent
                acquisition and integration of these stores into the Group has
                given us the appetite & experience, notwithstanding the
                financial strength to take on further portfolio acquisitions as
                and when they may arise.
